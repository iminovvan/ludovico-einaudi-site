                    <legend>Who is Ludovico Einaudi?</legend>
                    <p>Italian pianist and composer Ludovico Einaudi has achieved major success 
                    with his introspective, atmospheric music, which has roots in minimalism and 
                    modern composition but expands to incorporate influences from rock and pop as 
                    well as African and Middle Eastern musics. His earliest works were compositions 
                    for theater and ballet during the 1980s, with 1988's <b>Time Out</b> serving as his debut 
                    album. Einaudi's first solo piano full-length, 1996's <b>Le Onde</b>, became a hit, and 
                    was eventually certified gold in Italy and silver in the United Kingdom. He 
                    received acclaim for subsequent film and television scores such as Luce dei 
                    miei occhi (2002) and <b>Sotto falso nome</b> (2004), while his studio albums included 
                    a collaboration with kora player <b>Ballaké Sissoko</b> and 
                    orchestral works such as 2006's<b> Divenire</b>. Einaudi ventured into electronic 
                    music with his 2009 collaboration with members of <b>To Rococo Rot</b> under the name 
                    <b>Whitetree</b>, as well as solo efforts such as 2013's <b>In a Time Lapse</b>. He broke 
                    streaming records with the first volume of 2019's <b>Seven Days Walking</b>, then returned 
                    to solo piano work with 2020's <b>12 Songs from Home</b> and 2022's <b>Underwater</b>.</p>

                    <legend>Life and Music</legend>
                    <p>Einaudi was born in Turin on November 23, 1955. His mother, also a pianist, would 
                        play for him as a young child, planting the seeds for what would become a fruitful, 
                        illustrious career. He played in a few bands during the 1970s, including 
                        progressive group <b>Venegoni & Co</b>. Einaudi studied under <b>Luciano Berio</b> at the 
                        Conservatory of Milan, graduating with a diploma in composition. In 1982, his 
                        talents would win him a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Festival. The experience 
                        opened Einaudi's ears to new ideas like minimalism, world music influences, and 
                        aspects of pop music. He spent the next several years composing for the ballet, 
                        including Sul Filo d'Orfeo (1984), Time-Out (1988), and The Wild Man (1991). 
                        Einaudi turned a corner in 1996 with the release of his first collection of solo 
                        performances, entitled <b>Le Onde</b>. This record started him down the path toward becoming 
                        one of Europe's best-selling pianist/composers. <b>Eden Roc</b> and <b>I Giorni</b> (2001), both for BMG, captured the solo 
                        piano world's attention, both remaining best-sellers for years to come.</p>

                    <legend> The way ahead </legend>
                    <p>While seemingly at the top of the composition world, Einaudi ventured into film 
                        composition. Einaudi noted in interviews during this period that he missed 
                        playing concerts, and he began performing again regularly. New works blossomed 
                        from this effort, including 2003's <b>Diario Mali</b>, with Malian kora player <b>Ballaké Sissoko</b>, 
                        and 2004's <b>Una Mattina</b>. Einaudi's seventh studio album, 2006's Divenire, 
                        found him accompanied by the <b>Royal Liverpool Philharmonic</b>. He then worked with 
                        <b>Robert and Ronald Lippok</b> of electronic group To Rococo Rot under the name Whitetree, 
                        releasing the album <b>Cloudland</b> in 2009. His next solo album, <b>Nightbook</b>, was much more 
                        self-consciously reductionist, featuring solo piano minimally adorned with 
                        electronics, and saw Einaudi begin to be appreciated by fans of the "post-classical" 
                        school that he had arguably, at least in part, inspired.</p>

                    <legend>New Collaborations</legend>
                    <p>At the beginning of 2013, Einaudi signed a new deal with Decca and unveiled the 
                        long-gestating <b>In a Time Lapse</b>, which had been recorded in a remote monastery 
                        near Verona and saw a return to a more "classical" chamber music sound. <b>Taranta Project</b>,
                        an ambitious work incorporating numerous global influences, appeared in 
                        2015. This was followed by <b>Elements</b>, which featured violinist <b>Daniel Hope, the</b> 
                        <b>Amsterdam Sinfonietta, Robert Lippok</b>, and Brazilian percussionist <b>Mauro Refosco</b> 
                        among its guest performers. Recorded at his home studio in Italy, the album was 
                        inspired by nature, math, science, music, art, and how parts connect to form a 
                        whole. The record peaked at number 12 in the U.K., becoming the first 
                        classical album to reach the Top 15 of the chart in over two decades.</p>

                    <legend>Latest works</legend>
                    <p>In 2019, Einaudi unveiled <b>Seven Days Walking</b>, his most ambitious musical project 
                        to date, consisting of seven volumes to be released over the course of seven months, 
                        with a box set containing all seven releases in November. <b>Day One</b>, the first installment, 
                        debuted at the top of the U.K. Classical Artist Albums chart, and became the 
                        fastest-streamed classical release of all time worldwide, with over two million streams 
                        on its release day alone. Recorded at his home in Italy during the COVID-19 lockdown, 
                        Einaudi issued the aptly named <b>12 Songs from Home</b> in 2020. Another compilation,<b> Cinema</b>, 
                        appeared in 2021, and the composer's music for the drama film <b>The Father</b> was also released 
                        that year. <b>Underwater</b>, another solo piano album conceived under lockdown, was issued in 2022.</p>
